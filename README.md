# Learn Rust [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

## About

Greetings and welcome to my Rust learning journey!

I'm **Victor Monteragioni**, a developer who recently graduated from a **Application Designer Developer (CDA)** program
with a specialization in **Java Spring / Angular**.

### My motivations

After mastering the Java/Spring and Angular ecosystem, I decided to explore Rust for several reasons:

- **Performance**: Rust offers performance comparable to C/C++ with guaranteed memory safety
- **Safety**: Rust's type system prevents many common classes of errors
- **Modernity**: A modern language with excellent development tools
- **Versatility**: From systems programming to web development, including blockchain
- **Perfect complement**: After Java/Spring, Rust brings me a different perspective on programming

## Current Progress

**Step 6/331** - Introduction / Getting started

![Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/Progress-6%2F331%20(1.81%25)-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust)

This project contains small exercises to get me used to reading and writing Rust code, including reading and responding
to compiler messages!
